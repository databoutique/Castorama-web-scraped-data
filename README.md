## About the website

Established in 1969 in Lille, France by Christian DUBREUIL, **Castorama** is a top-tier retail chain that specializes in the sale of DIY home improvement and garden supplies. This French corporation operates under its parent company, [Kingfisher plc](https://www.kingfisher.com/), a multinational retail organization that is listed on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol [KGF](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/KGF/kingfisher-plc/analysis). The said parent company has a market cap long exceeding that of Castoramas initial IPO. For those interested in further information, Castoramas rich history and business exploits are detailed on their [Wikipedia page](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castorama) and, for key financial information, the [Bloomberg page](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/818491Z:FP).

In the heavily competitive market of home improvement retail, **Castorama** stands tall among the likes of [Leroy Merlin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_Merlin), [Brico Dépôt](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brico_Dépôt), and [B&Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%26Q). Leroy Merlin is a key competitor and operates under a similar business model, offering home improvement and gardening solutions to consumers. Like Castorama, Brico Dépôt offers DIY supplies, however, puts a stronger emphasis on wholesale and working with professional tradesmen. Lastly, B&Q, although operating under Kingfisher, is a direct competitor within the UK market, dealing with home improvement and garden supplies. Each player can be studied more in-depth via their respective Wikipedia or, for their financial standing, Bloomberg pages.
